Face Recognition Based Attendance System
👩‍💻 Project Overview

This project is an automated attendance management system that uses Face Recognition to mark attendance from a group photo or live camera feed. The system detects and identifies faces using pre-trained encodings, and automatically updates a CSV attendance file with the names of present and absent students.

It eliminates the need for manual attendance and ensures accuracy, efficiency, and time saving in classrooms or workplaces.

🚀 Key Features

Automated Attendance — Detects and marks attendance directly from a group photo.

Face Recognition — Uses advanced deep learning (CNN model) for high accuracy.

CSV Attendance Reports — Saves attendance with timestamps for easy record keeping.

Visual Feedback — Generates an annotated image with recognized faces.

Scalable — Works for multiple students or employees with simple dataset updates.

⚙️ Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/supriya-mukkamalla/attendance_ml.git
cd attendance_ml

2️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows

3️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install face_recognition opencv-python numpy


🔹 Note: You may also need to install dlib for face recognition.
On macOS: brew install cmake before installing face_recognition.

🧠 How It Works

Dataset Preparation

Create a folder named dataset/.

Inside it, add one subfolder per student (e.g., supriya/, mohana/)

Each folder should contain several clear face images of that student.

Encode Faces
Run the script below to generate face encodings:

python3 scripts/encode_faces.py


This creates encodings.pickle containing facial features for all students.

Mark Attendance from a Group Photo

Place your group image as group_photo.jpg

Then run:

python3 scripts/attendance_from_group.py


The system detects faces, matches them with encodings, and marks attendance in attendance.csv.

View Results

Open group_photo_annotated.jpg to see recognized faces with bounding boxes.

Open attendance.csv to view attendance with timestamps.

📊 Output Example
group_photo_annotated.jpg

✅ Green boxes around recognized faces with their names.
