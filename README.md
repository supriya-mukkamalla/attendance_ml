Face Recognition Based Attendance System
👩‍💻 Project Overview

This project is an automated attendance management system that uses Face Recognition to mark attendance from a group photo or live camera feed. The system detects and identifies faces using pre-trained encodings, and automatically updates a CSV attendance file with the names of present and absent students.

It eliminates the need for manual attendance and ensures accuracy, efficiency, and time saving in classrooms or workplaces.

🚀 Key Features

✅ Automated Attendance – Detects and marks attendance directly from a group photo.

🧠 Face Recognition – Uses advanced deep learning (CNN model) for high accuracy.

📊 CSV Attendance Reports – Saves attendance with timestamps for easy record keeping.

🖼️ Visual Feedback – Generates an annotated image with recognized faces.

🌐 Scalable – Works for multiple students or employees with simple dataset updates.

⚙️ Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/supriya-mukkamalla/attendance_ml.git
cd attendance_ml

2️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # On Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate         # On Windows

3️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install face_recognition opencv-python numpy


⚠️ Note: You may also need to install dlib for face recognition.
On macOS, run:

brew install cmake
pip install dlib

🧠 How It Works

Prepare Dataset

Create a folder named dataset/.

Inside it, add one subfolder per student (e.g., supriya/, mohana/).

Each folder should contain several clear face images of that person.

Generate Face Encodings

python3 scripts/encode_faces.py


This creates encodings.pickle containing facial features for all students.

Mark Attendance from a Group Photo

python3 scripts/attendance_from_group.py


The script detects faces, matches them, and updates attendance.csv.

View Results

🖼️ Open group_photo_annotated.jpg for recognized faces.

📄 Open attendance.csv for attendance with timestamps.

📊 Output Example
group_photo_annotated.jpg

✅ Green boxes around recognized faces with their names.
